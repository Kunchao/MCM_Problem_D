# The Flight is Flying


Our group prepare for the comprtition called MCM/ICM. Finally we choose the problem D which belongs to ICM.
The basic theory is based on the allocation of resources to maximize the throughoutput of airport. It's unpleasant to wait in long lines for security checks. Whereares，the part is important to security.
Our work is to analyze the data provided by coumunity to develop a models to explore the flow of
passengers and find the key way to overcoem it. 


[MCM/ICM Contest](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/)
**Here are the questions**:

> * Develop one or more model(s) that allow(s) you to explore the flow of
passengers through a security check point and identify bottlenecks. Clearly
identify where problem areas exist in the current process.
> * Develop two or more potential modifications to the current process to improve
passenger throughput and reduce variance in wait time. Model these changes to
demonstrate how your modifications impact the process.
> * It is well known that different parts of the world have their own cultural norms that
shape the local rules of social interaction. Consider how these cultural norms
might impact your model. For example, Americans are known for deeply
respecting and prioritizing the personal space of others, and there is a social
stigma against “cutting” in front of others. Meanwhile, the Swiss are known for
their emphasis on collective efficiency, and the Chinese are known for prioritizing
individual efficiency. Consider how cultural differences may impact the way in
which passenger’s process through checkpoints as a sensitivity analysis. The
cultural differences you apply to your sensitivity analysis can be based on real
cultural differences, or you can simulate different traveler styles that are not
associated with any particular culture (e.g., a slower traveler). How can the
security system accommodate these differences in a manner that expedites
passenger throughput and reduces variance?
> * Propose policy and procedural recommendations for the security managers
based on your model. These policies may be globally applicable, or may be
tailored for specific cultures and/or traveler types.


he final result is as follows(alll graphs are edited with **Echart**):
